Hi all,

This is my first gtk theme.  It's a poor way to emulate Mac OSX UI.
This theme probably can be improved with rounded buttons, if someone
makes a better pixmap engine with anti-aliases, alpha binding, and static
positioning of smaller pixmap.  If no one write it, you can hope I
will find the time to do it.   I hope someone would do it before I
figure out gtk.

Since some of the pictures are captured from Apple Mac OSX screenshot,
I am not qualify to say that all data goes under GPL License.  Ask
lawyers near you.

Special thanks to frantzdb, who created original gtk-x theme.  He did a
good job copy Mac OSX's scroller, and I copied his scroller.

Apple, please don't sue me.

regards,
